(duration: 25 mins)

<ul>
    <li>Introduce yourself</li>
    <li>No technical questions were asked.</li>
    <li>Why I didn't got PPO after my internship got over?</li>
    <li>Why the PPO was given to another guy? (I was getting tested at this point. Instead of hiding anything I openly spoke up that the guy who recieved the PPO was well deserved)</li>
    <li>Cross Question came - What did you learned from that guy? - I answered that he was a person with a lots of knowledge then too with 0 ego. He helped me out throughout my intern and which resulted in me becoming a full stack developer.</li>
    <li>I was asked about my hobbies, where I tried to trick the interviewer but I got caught. I said reading books is my hobbie and when he asked me a writer of a book, I failed to answer it. (Be careful while mentioning your hobbies in resume)</li>
    <li>I was asked if I'm comfortable with reallocatring and also a little bit about my family background.</li>
</ul>

## **Tips and Tricks:**

<ul>
    <li>In my tech interview the interviewer tried to frustrate me but I tried y best to be calm and stick to the point I mentioned.</li>
    <li>Never tell that the project you were working on was left incomplete even if your goal was achieved.</li>
    <li>Try to be calm even when your mistale got caught in interview. (Like my hobbie)</li>
    <li>You must ask a question to the interviewer at the end (only if you think the interviewer was trying to be friendly with you.)</li>
</ul>
