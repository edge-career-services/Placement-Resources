    <li>A few questions on your project</li>
    <li>You are from the AI/ML domain. Have you worked with ML on the cloud? (My Answer: No, I haven't worked practically with Azure or anything similar on any personal project due to its cost. However, I have received training on it during my PwC and Amazon Apprenticeships, so I can quickly adapt to it. 
    TIP:
    Be honest but also mention how you would tackle something you haven't done, not by saying "I am hardworking" but with something believable.)
    </li>
    <li>(I don't remember much about this; it's advisable to refer to the GeeksforGeeks archives before preparing.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>HR Questions:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>I would write something similar, but I don't remember the exact words:</li>
    <li>What is RISES?</li>
    <li>Let's suppose you are given a task to complete. What would be your workflow?</li>
    <li>
    A task needs to be completed in 30 days with 100 quality tests, but the client requires it in 20 days. Your senior suggests performing only 50 main quality tests, as it would be sufficient for the task at hand. What would you do?My Answer: No, I wouldn't do it. According to RISES (E=Excellence), I will strive for excellence and not compromise on quality. I would discuss the importance of maintaining quality standards with the client, as I believe no one would prefer a lower quality product. Moreover, delivering a low quality product would not align with "Stewardship," one of the core values Barclays adheres to.
    </li>

<li> 
        Your senior suggests something deprecated or not relevant to today's real-world application. How would you convince him that your approach is correct, especially when he might say you are new to the industry and he is your senior?
        My Answer: (I smiled a bit, then he rephrased the same question. Then I said: I don’t expect anyone from Barclays to not follow one of its values, Integrity, which advocates treating everyone fairly. Besides that, with that expectation, I would answer that I would ask for his free slot and talk to him with actual data... something along those lines.)
    </li>

<li>
        Interviewer: Okay, now if you are the head and the team needs to build an application that won't be finished on time, what would you do?
        Me: I wouldn’t proceed as is. I would take proper time.
        Interviewer: No, you can't say no now. You are the head of Barclays India, and the application needs to be presented to its shareholders.
        Me: In that case, I would first ask my team to focus on the basic features of our application to make it workable enough to showcase. Also, considering that if some part of the application is not risky, then we could outsource the work to companies like TATA to help us complete on time. However, since we are a financial firm, it would depend on whether we can outsource or not.
    </li>

<li>
        <strong>Tip:</strong>
        It's okay to say no. I said no so much that he had to say that I can't say no now. So, just be confident and think about every aspect carefully, and do put forward something related to the company if possible, as in my case it was one of its values.
    </li>
</ul>

## **Tips and Tricks:**
<ul>
    <li>
        Be confident. 
        (While it's common advice, the pressure you'll feel when sitting for an interview with a Superdream company is real. A helpful mindset in such situations is to "pretend as if you don't want the job." This can help alleviate some of the pressure and allow you to present yourself more naturally.)
    </li>
    
<li>
        It's okay to say No.
        (Interviewers may pose tricky questions, aiming to see how you handle challenging situations. It's important to think through your responses carefully. While saying yes might seem polite, being able to respectfully disagree and provide reasoned explanations can set you apart.)
    </li>

<li>
        Learn about the company.
        (Understanding the company's values and culture is crucial. For example, knowing what "RISES" stands for can be particularly significant during the HR round.)
    </li>

<li>
        Try solving the 50 marks question.
        (Prioritize tackling the high-value questions, such as those worth 50 marks, as they can significantly impact your overall score. It's not just about answering more questions but answering the ones that count more towards your final evaluation.)
    </ul>
