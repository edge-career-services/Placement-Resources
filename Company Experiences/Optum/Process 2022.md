### **Additional Comments:**

- For the Optum interview, it's crucial to prepare well on Python concepts, especially related to class, objects, iterators, and generators. Be ready to discuss your experience with machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as the basics of DSA.
- Understanding the concepts of OOPs, Java, and the basics of sorting algorithms will also be beneficial.
- The HR questions focus on personal preferences, family background, internship experiences, and motivation for the role. Preparing thoughtful answers for these questions will be important.
