## **Tips and Tricks:**

<ul>
    <li>The code that I wrote in online coding round, was well formatted even there was no formatting option avaiable. It took time to write the code but might have made some impact.</li>
    <li>Answer only what you have been asked, i.e. don't ellongate your answers too much even if you know it all.</li>
    <li>If you don't know the answer then just try to make things interractive instead of finding the right answer. (I didn't knew those aptitude questions in 2nd Interview)</li>
    <li>Be confident (Especially while answering the questions like last 2 that the interviewer asked me in tech round 2)</li>
</ul>
